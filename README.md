## Recreate Hacker News

https://news.ycombinator.com/ is a very popular site for the hacker/dev community. You can find jobs and a lot of really relevant news. Think of it as the Reddit for the hacker community where you can upvote and leave comments on posts. The joy of Hacker News is found in its simplicity and its ease of use. We devs do not need anything fancy, just something to get us the information we need. We're not designers.

Your goal in this challenge is to write HTML code that simulates Hacker News. Don't worry about styling yet, we'll get to that later. Just get the overall look down!
